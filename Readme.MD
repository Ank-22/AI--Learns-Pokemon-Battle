# AI--Learns-Pokemon-Battle


## Acknowledgements

This project is a follow-up of a group project from an artifical intelligence class at [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/).

You can find the original repository [here](https://github.com/hsahovic/inf581-project). It is partially inspired by the [showdown-battle-bot project](https://github.com/Synedh/showdown-battle-bot). Of course, none of these would have been possible without [Pokemon Showdown](https://github.com/Zarel/Pokemon-Showdown).

Team data comes from [Smogon forums' RMT section](https://www.smogon.com/).

## Thanks to Poke-Env:
